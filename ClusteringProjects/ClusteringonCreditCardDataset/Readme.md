In this project, I clustered the non-labelled credit card data into labelled data using two clustering techniques:
1. K-means Clustering
2. Agglomerative Complete Clustering

I classified whole dataset into 4 market segments. Each segement has its own characteristics. I evaluated both models using silhouette score and 0.21 for K-means and 0.71 for Agglomerative complete model.
