This folder contains a classification-based supervised learning project. The goal is to predict whether the given person has diabetes or not by evaluating different features. I used Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and GridSearchCV for classification. I have achieved an accuracy score of 0.80, precision = 0.73, recall = 0.67, and f1-score=0.69. The model is then deployed using Dash.
